#Travel Route Optimisation

Overview

This repository contains the coursework solution for optimising travel routes between Fort Railway Station and Borella Junction in Colombo. The project compares bus and taxi travel using mathematical modelling, cost analysis, passenger demand prediction, and signal/image processing techniques.

All work is implemented in a single IPython Notebook with code, plots, and Markdown-based explanations.

Methods Used

Quadratic travel time models and gradient analysis

Definite integration for fare comparison

Series approximation for peak-hour prediction

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for travel pattern analysis

Fourier/DCT-based image processing and edge detection

Technologies

Python, NumPy, SymPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

How to Run

Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, upload the image if required, and run all cells.
